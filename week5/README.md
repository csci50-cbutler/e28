## Notes For Instructor

This game is called Word Scrambler.  It can be launched at http://e28p5.prodtechhub.me 

When launched, it will prompt the player for their name and click the button to begin.

Next steps:
1. A scrambled word will appear with a hint on a separate line.
2. An input field will also appear for player to input guess.
3. Click button to check guess.
4. A message will appear if correct or incorrect. If the answer is correct you can proceed as follows:

	* The game reset with a new scramble word and a hint
	* Repeate steps 2 and 3 above
